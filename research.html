    <h1>My research</h1>
    <p> Today, more than 55% of people globally live in urban areas, and it is projected to reach 68% by 2050. The accelerated urbanization has contributed to the deterioration of the transportation system, particularly in densely populated areas. Consequently, challenges and opportunities arise in both supply and demand in urban transport. On the one hand, the evolving technology and infrastructure, including autonomous and connected vehicles (AV, CAV), high-speed railways, Internet of Thing (IoT), artificial intelligence, etc., excite a much more fertile imagination on future transport. The resultant upgraded or emerging transportation modes, such as Transportation as a Service (TaaS) or shared mobility, have intelligently transformed and will continue to change our lives in cities, from the aspects of individual travel behaviours to urban land use. On the other hand, during urbanization, in addition to the increasing and diversifying passenger and logistic demands for travel, the appeals from the public are growing for better urban mobility in diverse dimensions, e.g., efficiency, accessibility, privacy, reliability, robustness etc. These ever-stronger urges, in turn, drive the development of smart transport. </p>
    <p> Given such on-going transformation in travel supply and demand, my research focuses on addressing the urban transport issues towards the smart transport future, leveraging on the methodologies from economics, operation research, civil engineering, and data science. The topics to my interest include emerging transport policies, commuting traffic management, integrated land use and transport planning, flexible work arrangement, and their cross-fields in transportation. In particular, the smart transport that I refer to is not only the emerging smart transport modes or services, but also the strategic planning and management of urban transport system with foresight. I am ambitious with my research to facilitate the cities to better manage the travel supply and demand in future transport and to achieve efficient, sustainable, resilient, and smart urban mobility. </p>
 	

    	<p>My research projects are summarized below. </p>
   	<hr>
	<h2>Commuting Traffic management. </h2>
	<p>  Peak hour traffic congestion has always been a challenge in city management. Due to the ubiquitous jobs-housing separation in most metropolitans, commuters inevitably need to travel between home and workplace, imposing negative externalities to others. Their commuting behaviours also evolve, particularly with emerging transports. To better manage the commuting traffic, an important issue is to understand commuters’ decision makings on travel modes, departure time and schedule choices. I conduct analytical studies from diverse perspectives on commuter’s within-day travel behaviours considering emerging transports, such as the mode choice between driving with parking need and using ride-sourcing service (Su & Wang, 2019), and the parking location choices with distant parking options in AV era (Su & Wang, 2020b). In addition to re-examining the widely discussed measures, I also aim to look for the easy-to-implement, commuter-friendly, yet effective measures in commuting traffic management. </p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Flexible work arrangement (FWA). </h2>
	<p>  It cannot be denied that most traffic congestions, particularly during peak hours, are mainly attributed to agglomerated travel demand resulted from the rigid working hours in urban areas. Though FWAs are not recent concepts, their popularization has been hindered over the past few decades, not until the recent outbreak of the pandemic. To promote the popularization of FWAs and achieve sustainable transport with optimized travel demand, I conduct studies on various FWAs, such as compressed work schedule (Su & Wang, 2020a), flextime and telecommuting, examining not only their impacts on traffic congestion, but also the impacts on productivity, public health, and social welfare.</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Integrated land use and transport planning. </h2> 
	<p> In city centres of many metropolises, e.g., Hong Kong, Singapore, the land spaces are limited with exorbitant prices. It is of immense necessity to optimize the land use to cater to contemporary mobility needs in social benefit maximization. The planning of transport infrastructure should be reassessed in advance to equip city regulators with foresight in tackling the future transport issues. For instance, envisioning the self-parking capability in future transport, the parking land in downtown can be saved for other productive usages by shifting more parking spaces outwards. Thus, I carry out studies on the CBD parking provision with AVs (Su et al., 2020b) and the spatial parking planning design with mixed human-driven and automated traffic. Also, to accelerate the vehicle to everything (V2X) roadway upgrade towards vehicles autonomy, I examine its build-operate-transfer model to introduce private capitals.</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Emerging transport policies. </h2> 
	<p> With the boost in information and communication technology, a tremendous quantity increment in novel transport modes or services can be foreseen. These emerging transports, on the one hand, can better fulfil the consumer needs on mobility; however, on the other hand, may bring side-effects to society. As extensions to my previous studies, I would continue to explore novel and technically feasible managing measures or policies on emerging transport to pursue smarter mobility, e.g., the smart management of distant shared parking via IoT, the flexible supply between ride-sourcing service and parking. </p> 
	<hr>
	<p> Overall, I see myself as a researcher who applies the methodological skills and tools from interdisciplinary to provide practical insights into urban transport issues. I am proud to devote myself to these challenging yet exciting problems towards future smart transport.</p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> We use standardized end-of-course knowledge assessments to examine student learning during the disruptions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Examining seven economics courses taught at four US R1 institutions, we find that students performed substantially worse, on average, in Spring 2020 when compared to Spring or Fall 2019. We find no evidence that the effect was driven by specific demographic groups. However, our results suggest that teaching methods that encourage active engagement, such as the use of small group activities and projects, played an important role in mitigating this negative effect. Our results point to methods for more effective online teaching as the pandemic continues. </p></div>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> We study heterogeneity in the effect of immigrant labor supply on native wages in the United States using quasi-experimental variation induced by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Act quickly and substantially increased the number of immigrant workers in STEM occupations. Using CPS data, we find short-run policy effects of reduced wages for more substitutable workers but increased wages for more complementary workers. We analyze long-term effects of the policy using administrative earnings data and find smaller long-run effects. </p></div><br>
