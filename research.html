    <h2><a name="intro" id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#Introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction<br>简介</h2>

    <p> Today, more than 55% of people globally live in urban areas, and it is projected to reach 68% by 2050. The accelerated urbanization has contributed to the deterioration of the transportation system, particularly in densely populated areas. Consequently, challenges and opportunities arise in both supply and demand in urban transport. On the one hand, the evolving technology and infrastructure, including <em>autonomous and connected vehicles (AV, CAV), high-speed railways, Internet of Thing (IoT), artificial intelligence</em>,etc., excite a much more fertile imagination on future transport. The resultant upgraded or emerging transportation modes, such as Transportation as a Service (TaaS) or shared mobility, have intelligently transformed and will continue to change our lives in cities, from the aspects of individual travel behaviours to urban land use. On the other hand, during urbanization, in addition to the increasing and diversifying passenger and logistic demands for travel, the appeals from the public are growing for better urban mobility in diverse dimensions, e.g., efficiency, accessibility, privacy, reliability, robustness etc. These ever-stronger urges, in turn, drive the development of smart transport. </p>
    <p> Given such on-going transformation in travel supply and demand, <b>my research focuses on addressing the urban transport issues towards the smart transport future, leveraging on the methodologies from economics, operation research, civil engineering, and data science</b>. The topics to my interest include <em>Emerging transport policies, Commuting traffic management, Integrated land use and transport planning, Flexible work arrangement</em>, and their cross-fields in transportation. In particular, the smart transport that I refer to is not only the emerging smart transport modes or services, but also the strategic planning and management of urban transport system with foresight. I am ambitious with my research to facilitate the cities to better manage the travel supply and demand in future transport and to achieve efficient, sustainable, resilient, and smart urban mobility. </p>

   	<p> Here are the summaries of my research projects and plans.</p>
	
	<h3><a name="aa">Commuting Traffic management<br>通勤交通管理 </a> </h3>
    	<p class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Peak hour traffic congestion has always been a challenge in city management. Due to the ubiquitous jobs-housing separation in most metropolitans, commuters inevitably need to travel between home and workplace, imposing negative externalities to others. Their commuting behaviours also evolve, particularly with emerging transports. To better manage the commuting traffic, an important issue is to understand commuters’ decision makings on travel modes, departure time and schedule choices. I conduct analytical studies from diverse perspectives on commuter’s within-day travel behaviours considering emerging transports, such as the mode choice between driving with parking need and using ride-sourcing service (Su & Wang, 2019), and the parking location choices with distant parking options in AV era (Su & Wang, 2020b). In addition to re-examining the widely discussed measures, I also aim to look for the easy-to-implement, commuter-friendly, yet effective measures in commuting traffic management.</p>

	<h3><a name="bb">Flexible work arrangement (FWA) <br>灵活工作制度 </a></h3>
    	<p class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> It cannot be denied that most traffic congestions, particularly during peak hours, are mainly attributed to agglomerated travel demand resulted from the rigid working hours in urban areas. Though FWAs are not recent concepts, their popularization has been hindered over the past few decades, not until the recent outbreak of the pandemic. To promote the popularization of FWAs and achieve sustainable transport with optimized travel demand, I conduct studies on various FWAs, such as compressed work schedule (Su & Wang, 2020a), flextime and telecommuting, examining not only their impacts on traffic congestion, but also the impacts on productivity, public health, and social welfare.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3><a name="cc">Integrated land use and transport planning <br>综合土地利用及运输规划</a> </h3> 
    	<p class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> In city centres of many metropolises, e.g., Hong Kong, Singapore, the land spaces are limited with exorbitant prices. It is of immense necessity to optimize the land use to cater to contemporary mobility needs in social benefit maximization. The planning of transport infrastructure should be reassessed in advance to equip city regulators with foresight in tackling the future transport issues. For instance, envisioning the self-parking capability in future transport, the parking land in downtown can be saved for other productive usages by shifting more parking spaces outwards. Thus, I carry out studies on the CBD parking provision with AVs (Su et al., 2020b) and the spatial parking planning design with mixed human-driven and automated traffic. Also, to accelerate the vehicle to everything (V2X) roadway upgrade towards vehicles autonomy, I examine its build-operate-transfer model to introduce private capitals.</p>

	<h3><a name="dd">Emerging transport policies <br>新兴交通政策及管理</a> </h3> 
    	<p class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">
	With the boost in information and communication technology, a tremendous quantity increment in novel transport modes or services can be foreseen. These emerging transports, on the one hand, can better fulfil the consumer needs on mobility; however, on the other hand, may bring side-effects to society. As extensions to my previous studies, I would continue to explore novel and technically feasible managing measures or policies on emerging transport to pursue smarter mobility, e.g., the smart management of distant shared parking via IoT, the flexible supply between ride-sourcing service and parking.
	</p>

	<p> Overall, I see myself as a researcher who applies the methodological skills and tools from interdisciplinary to provide practical insights into urban transport issues. I am proud to devote myself to these challenging yet exciting problems towards future smart transport.</p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Managing morning commute traffic through parking provision management has been well studied in the literature. One conventional assumption made in most previous studies is that all commuters require parking spaces at CBD area. However, in recent years, due to technological advancements and low market entry barrier, more and more e-dispatch FHVs (eFHVs) are provided in service. The rapidly growing eFHVs, on one hand, supply substantial trip services and complete the trips requiring no parking demand; on the other hand, imposes congestion effects on all commuters. In this study, we investigate the morning commute problem with bottleneck congestion and parking space constraints in the presence of ride-sourcing service. The within-day dynamic equilibrium and its travel pattern are examined. Meanwhile, we explore the optimal supply of parking spaces and ride-sourcing services to best manage the commute traffic. To minimize system total travel costs, the optimal quantity control of parking spaces and eFHVs is determined, which indeed addresses a critical issue on how to regulate the supply of eFHVs. </p></div><br>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Compressed work schedule (CW) is one of the widely known flexible work hours arrangements(FWAs). In the literature, it has been clearly demonstrated that CW can significantly reduce commuting trips per pay period and thereby relieve peak hour congestion. Without policy intervention, how many firms will choose CW? Is it socially beneficial to encourage all commuters to switch to CW? This paper mainly addresses these questions. A bi-level economic model encapsulating employers’ and employees’ choices on their work schedule is then developed. Firstly, the short-run daily and periodic commute patterns of employees are investigated in a modified activity-based bottleneck model. On top of that, the effects of CW on firms’ productivity are incorporated into our long-run analysis. At long-run equilibrium, no employers and employees can benefit by unilaterally switching their schedule type or changing their schedule design. Multiple equilibria are found with the different number of CW users, depending on the agglomeration rate of productivity and the initial status. The social optimums to maximize total net utility are also determined. At a low rate of agglomeration, it is socially beneficial to introduce CW and the system can achieve the social optimum naturally at long-run equilibrium with positive CW users, under mild assumptions. However, when the agglomeration rate is high, the social optimum is no longer achieved, and workers would stick to the normal schedule at equilibrium if the initial case without CW is considered. This can partially explain why CW is not commonly adopted in practice.</p></div><br>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Due to the confined span of parking location choice for human-driven vehicles (HVs), the spatiotemporal imbalance in parking space utilization has always been a challenging problem in many major cities, leading to a substantial waste of precious land resources. However, in the era of autonomous vehicles (AVs) with parking autonomy, there are more alternative parking options available as AV can park at more distant locations away from the trip maker’s destination. This paper aims to investigate the morning commute problem with consideration of AV commuters’ distant parking choices in a many-to-one network. Parking sharing scheme is explicitly considered, wherein AV travellers can choose to park at city centre at public parking facilities and then lease their own parking space out, park at home, or park at a shared parking space. We first examine how AV commuters in different residential clusters prioritize their parking location choices, as well as their willingness to share the vacant parking space. Then, we investigate the travellers’ trip timing decisions and determine the resultant equilibrium travel pattern. Without other dynamic managing schemes, the model results indicate that appropriate CBD parking supply, together with differentiated parking charges/subsidy, can reduce the total queueing congestion significantly, yet at the cost of higher total travel cost.</p></div><br>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> We study heterogeneity in the effect of immigrant labor supply on native wages in the United States using quasi-experimental variation induced by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Act quickly and substantially increased the number of immigrant workers in STEM occupations. Using CPS data, we find short-run policy effects of reduced wages for more substitutable workers but increased wages for more complementary workers. We analyze long-term effects of the policy using administrative earnings data and find smaller long-run effects. </p></div><br>
